Laboratory: Linux and Emacs scavenger hunt

1. man -k xxxxx
   Here xxxxx is the specific keyword.
   For example, we can use "man -k printf" to search, 
   and get all commands that have keyword 'printf" in their man pages.

2. which cp 
   which wc
   These two commands output /usr/local/cs/bin/cp 
   and /usr/local/cs/bin/wc, respectively.

   whereis cp
   whereis wc
   I also used those two commands above and got more output.
   cp: /usr/bin/cp 
   /usr/local/cs/bin/cp 
   /usr/share/man/man1/cp.1.gz 
   /usr/share/man/man1p/cp.1p.gz
   wc: /usr/bin/wc 
   /usr/local/cs/bin/wc 
   /usr/share/man/man1/wc.1.gz 
   /usr/share/man/man1p/wc.1p.gz

   In this problem, it's better to use which instead of whereis.
   which command gives us location of the binary.
   Besides location of the binary file, 
   whereis command also gives us locations of the source, 
   and manual page files.

3. find /usr/bin/ -executable -name ?
   And the output is 
   /usr/bin/[
   /usr/bin/w
   /usr/bin/X
   
   By using man command on all three commands above, 
   I got following explanations: 

   [ - BASH BUILTIN COMMANDS.
   w - displays info about current users, and their processes.
   X - a portable, network-transparent window system.
   
   (At first, I got no "No manual entry for X", 
   but with the help of Piazza and using "whereis X" command, 
   I found out the problem existed within our linux server, 
   as there is only the binary for X, but no manual page. )

4. readlink /usr/bin/emacs
   And the output is /etc/alternatives/emacs.
   If we "cd /usr/bin", and then "ls -l | grep emacs", 
   we will be able to see the link "/etc/alternatives/emacs", 
   which confirms with the answer above.

5. "chmod g+s" sets Group ID,
	and all new files created within this directory 
        have their group set to this directory's group.

	"chmod o-x", the execution permission for others is removed.
	"o" stands for others,
	and "x" stands for execution.

	These two answers can be found by using "man chmod".

6. find -mtime -21
   According to man find, we can see the -mtime option is used to get
   the modification time of the files.
   And we use 21, because there are 21 segments of 24 hours in 3 weeks.

7. find / -type d -mtime -21
   By using man find, I found the option -type d, 
   where d means directory.
   So the command above finds all directories modified in the last three weeks.

8. whereis find
   The above command shows me the directroy where "find" is. 
   And this directory is /usr/bin.
   
   cd /usr/bin
   I use cd command to change into this directory.

   find . -type l | wc
   There are 246 symbolic links found in this directory. 
   I started by "man find", and I saw -type l option is for symbolic links.
   And then I pipe the result into wc, which gives me the word count.

9. cd /usr/lib
   ls -lat
   Here I first changed directory into /usr/lib.
   And then I ls with option -lat.
   -t helps me sort by modification time, newest first.
   -a helps me find all files, including those starting with "."
   And I need to make sure I am looking for a regular file,
   which starts with a '-' instead of 'd' or 'l'

   So the oldest file is libgpg-error.so.0.10.0.

10. man locale
   local command gets its data from setting of the environment variables.

   In the manual page of "locale", we can see from 
   the second paragraph of the description that
   locale displays the current locale settings 
   for each locale category (see locale(5)), 
   based on the settings of the environment variables that 
   control the locale (see locale(7)).
   I also tried "localedef --help",
   but did not find the exact answer.

11. emacs
	C-h a sort
	C-x 0
	I opened an emacs window 
	and typed C-h a to search the keyword "sort".
	I changed the window using C-x 0,
	and then I copied the output and pasted below.

Buffer-menu-sort              M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column at point.
sort-columns                  M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region alphabetically by a certain range of columns.
sort-fields                   M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region lexicographically by the ARGth field of each
   line.
sort-lines                    M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-numeric-fields           M-x ... RET
   Sort lines in region numerically by the ARGth field of each line.
sort-pages                    M-x ... RET
   Sort pages in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-paragraphs               M-x ... RET
   Sort paragraphs in region alphabetically; argument means descending
   order.
sort-regexp-fields            M-x ... RET
   Sort the text in the region region lexicographically.
tabulated-list-col-sort       M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column of the mouse click E.
tabulated-list-sort           M-x ... RET
   Sort Tabulated List entries by the column at point.

12. e m a c s
	C-h b
	C-x 0
	C-s C - M - a
	By using the commands above, 
	I opened a help manual with all the keys translations.
	After I changed the window,
	I search for the command "C-M-a",
	And I got actions for "C-M-a" through "C-M-h" listed as following. 

C-M-a           beginning-of-defun
C-M-b           backward-sexp
C-M-c           exit-recursive-edit
C-M-d           down-list
C-M-e           end-of-defun
C-M-f           forward-sexp
C-M-h           mark-defun

13. e m a c s
	C-h b
	C-x 0
	C-s C - g
	The first three commands are the same as last problem's.
	And I use C-s to search for the command "C-g",
	getting the output bellow.

	C-g             keyboard-quit

	And I moved the cursor to "keyboard-quit" and hit Enter key,
	getting the explanation below for this "keyboard-quit" action.
	It basically signal a quit condition.

(keyboard-quit is an interactive compiled Lisp function 
in 'simple.el'.
Signal a 'quit' condition.
During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.)

14. e m a c s
	C-h b
	C-x 0
	C-s y a n k
	The first three commands are still the same.
	And I searched for keyword "yank", getting following result.

	C-y             yank

	And I moved the cursor to "yank" and hit Enter key, 
	getting the explanation below for this "yank" action.
	It basically paste the most recent killed text.

(yank is an interactive compiled Lisp function in 'simple.el'.
Reinsert ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.
More precisely, reinsert the most recent kill, which is the
stretch of killed text most recently killed OR yanked.  Put point
at the end, and set mark at the beginning without activating it.
With just C-u as argument, put point at beginning, and mark at end.
With argument N, reinsert the Nth most recent kill.)

15. e m a c s
	C-h b
	C-x 0
	C-s d i r e d
	The first three commands are still the same.
	And I searched for keyword "dired", getting following result.

	C-x d           dired

	So I know the Emacs command for dired is C-x d
	By comparing the result of "ls -l" and "emacs dired",
	I saw current (.) and parrent (..) directories shown 
	at the very beginning of dired output,
	but not in the ls -l one.
