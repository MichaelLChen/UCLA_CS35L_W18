2. $ cd diffutils
   $ git checkout v3.0 -b quote
   I checked out version 3.0, 
   and then switched into new branch 'quote'.

[classgxu@lnxsrv07 ~/CS35L/lab9/submit/diffutils]

patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c

I applied my copy of patch onto the new branch.

5. $ emacs quote-3.0-patch.txt

   And then I used the emacs function to add ChangeLog 
   onto all the files with proper comments.

7. $ git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt
	With the above command, I generate a formatted patch.	
8. $ git checkout v3.0 -b partner
   $ git am formatted-patch-jl.txt

	My partner is Jianzhi Liu from Lab 8.
	First, I created a new temporary 
	branch 'partner' for him.

	After 'git am', I got a lot of warnings.

Applying: 2018-03-16 Jianzhi Liu <classkaj@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu>

	So I repeat step 13 in lab part.
	$ ./bootstrap
	$ patch -p0 <diffutils-gets.diff
	$ ./configure
	$ make

	After that, I checked if 
	it was built successfully.

	$ ./src/diff . -
	$ ./src/diff --

	Both of them output correct format, 
	using apostrophe ' instead of grave accent `

	$ make check
	It works perfectly.

9. $ make distdir
	I typed in this command on Jianzhi's laptop.
	This creates a directory 'diffutils-3.0.1-d083', 
	and it contains the ChangeLog of my patch. 
	He also generated my ChangeLog on his machine.
	So, we verified our ChangeLog entries work perfectly.

10. $ exit
	$ ssh -X classgxu@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
	$ git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
	$ cd emacs
	$ gitk

	Then I found the newest merge on 01/25/2015, 
	and took a screenshot.
